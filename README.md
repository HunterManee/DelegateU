This was my first major web development adventure.
All HTTPS, WSS and Databases have been deactivated
\n
FrontEnd:
  -Intracts with backend to gain information from Mongodb Server
  -Create Elments on the fly to be displayed to the user

Backend:
  -Includes an api manager for handling basic database intractions
    following the rules of CRUD ie. Create, Read, Update, and Delete
  -Includes websocket intraction so all users under a given login will
    see updates made by peers in real time


Was unable to get twilio up and running do to technical difficulties 
  of not being a company
